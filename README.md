```
- Put your photos in folder `/photos` with all of your albums.

**Example**:
```
├───photos
│   ├───albums1
│   │   ├───IMG1_01.jpg
│   │   ├───IMG1_02.png
│   │   │   └───...
│   ├───albums2
│   │   ├───IMG2_01.jpg
│   │   ├───IMG2_02.jpg
│   │   │   └───...
│   ├───albums3
│   │   ├───IMG3_01.png
│   │   ├───IMG3_02.jpg
│   │   │   └───...
... ... ...
```
- In Windows, open `PowerShell` and run
```
python .\tools\setup.py
```
- Personalize the contents of website at `_config.yml`.
- Commit all change and host your repo with github page
- ... and that's all your gallery

## How It Works

- `setup.py` will go through all of folders in `/photos/` directory and create a `config.json` file.
- It will collects all of information of each photo in your albums. It aggregates all data into one file called `config.json`.
- Once you've created your `config.json`, the website can use it to figure out which photos to show.
- It uses Jekyll template 🔥 and JavaScript ES6 to layout your photos, grouping all of the photos per album.
